This structure provides a Rock-Paper-Scissors Bot with machine learning capabilities. Here's a breakdown of the features:

Machine Learning Model:
Uses a simple neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras.
Predicts the player's next move based on historical data.
Game History Tracking:
Saves game results to a CSV file for training data.
Loads existing data to train or update the model.
Bot Decision Making:
Uses the trained model to predict the player's next move.
Chooses its own move based on the prediction.
User Interface:
Provides options to play games, train the bot, or exit.
Allows players to input their moves and view results.
Continuous Learning:
The bot learns patterns over time as more games are played and saved.
Users can manually trigger training sessions to update the model.
To use this Rock-Paper-Scissors Bot:

Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script: python main.py
Choose to play games or train the bot from the menu.
This implementation provides a solid foundation for a learning Rock-Paper-Scissors Bot. To further enhance it, you could consider:

Implementing more sophisticated AI algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning)
Adding visualizations of the bot's performance over time
Incorporating additional features like player profiling or adaptive difficulty levels
Expanding the game to support multiple players or tournament modes
Remember to test the bot thoroughly and adjust the model architecture or training parameters as needed to achieve optimal performance.
